gitignore .env and 

in .env set port = 3000;

 npm i mongoose 

modification on student controller
get,post,...

connect database with server
put them in common folder->utils

connect the database before listening on the server

change the .env db string

(for logger, we can use elastic search + kibanna if logger amount is large)

debugging：
-app.use(json()) not app.use(json)
-404. notfound middleware need to be placed after app.use('/v1',v1Router)
otherwise it will always be 404
